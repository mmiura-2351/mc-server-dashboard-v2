"""The one backup archive member rule (issues #3550, #3574, #3579).

Storage judges a backup member by this rule in restore and the health probe,
and its snapshot ingest takes only the names :func:`is_canonical_name` admits.
The servers upload gate judges each member by the same rule before an archive
is stored, so an upload is refused at once instead of failing later at restore
or sweep. It is a neutral root-level module, standard library only, so both
contexts' inward layers may import it. That is the ``rfc3339`` precedent in the
root-level import contract. Every caller first reads a member through
:func:`without_tar_root_prefix`.
