This is the edge wiring (ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.1). It is the only module
allowed to import ``adapters`` alongside ``application``/``domain`` and to read
configuration. Routers depend on the Port-returning provider functions here via
FastAPI's ``Depends``; tests override the providers to inject fakes.
