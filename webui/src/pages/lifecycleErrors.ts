/**
 * Map a lifecycle mutation error to its toast message (WEBUI_SPEC.md 7.4).
 *
 * The API returns 409 for lifecycle races (SPEC 7.4, "state changed —
 * refresh") and for several causes that are not races at all. A non-race whose
 * cause is worth naming gets its own message instead of the misleading generic
 * state-changed toast: the sanitized start/restart-failure categories
 * `port_conflict` / `image_missing` (issue #225), `server_unsettled` — the
 * at-rest precondition on the export mint (issue #2360) — the two contention
 * reasons `worker_busy` / `server_busy` (issue #2400), and the unclassified
 * dispatch failure `command_failed` (issue #2420).
 *
 * Three reasons keep the state-changed treatment, and all three are genuine
 * races: `invalid_transition`, `transition_conflict` and `server_not_running`
 * each mean the server really did move, or was never in the state the caller
 * assumed, so refreshing is the right response.
 *
 * 503 responses with a recognized `reason` (`no_eligible_worker`,
 * `worker_unavailable`, `jar_unavailable`) get their own message (issue #1092).
 * All other errors fall back to the generic action-failed toast.
 *
 * 403 is intentionally NOT handled here: it carries a side effect (refetching
 * capabilities) that lives in `useOnForbidden`. Callers run that glue first and
 * only reach this helper for non-403 errors.
 *
 * Returns a `TranslationKey` so both the dashboard quick actions and the
 * server-detail lifecycle controls (#378 Phase 4) share one mapping.

// 409 reasons that get a specific message; every other 409 keeps the
// state-changed treatment (see the header for why each one belongs there).
// `port_conflict`, `image_missing` and `worker_busy` are the sanitized dispatch
// categories, mirroring the API's `_SANITIZED_REASONS`
// (servers/application/command_dispatch.py).
// `server_unsettled` is the at-rest precondition on the export mint
// (servers/api/servers.py), which is a standing requirement rather than a race,
// so it names the precondition here too — the same message the danger-zone
// export already shows (issue #2360).
//
// `worker_busy` (the Worker already has a mutating lifecycle command in flight
// for this server; start/stop/restart can all hit it) and `server_busy` (a
// gated op held the API-side lifecycle lock past the acquire budget; start
// only) share one message: both mean the request was refused without being
// applied, both clear on their own once the other operation settles, and the
// operator's only move for either is to retry — naming which layer was busy
// would be Worker/API internals they cannot act on (issue #2400). The files and
// plugins tabs already name `server_busy` this way (`files.error.serverBusy`,
// `plugins.error.busy`); the lifecycle surfaces were the outlier.
//
// `command_failed` is the catch-all the API renders when a `CommandDispatchError`
// carries no sanitized reason (servers/api/servers.py) — an outcome the Worker
// did not classify, typically INTERNAL. It is NOT a race, so the state-changed
// toast was simply wrong (issue #2420), but neither is it a promise that nothing
// moved: only a failed start is compensated back to stopped. A failed stop has
// already committed desired=stopped over a still-running process, and a failed
// restart can leave the server DOWN — the Worker stops before it relaunches and
// does not recover a failed relaunch
// (instancemanager.go handleRestart). So the message names the failure and
// sends the operator to look at the server's state, rather than claiming either
// direction; it also does not promise a retry, since an unclassified driver
// failure is not known to clear on its own and the right verb to retry depends
// on where the server actually ended up.
//
// The refetch is deliberately kept (issue #2420): it is not a side effect of
// this mapping — every lifecycle mutation invalidates in `onSettled` regardless
// of outcome (DashboardPage.tsx / ServerDetailPage.tsx) — and for the stop and
// restart cases above the client's view really is stale, so dropping it for
// this reason would leave the toast pointing at a state the UI is not showing.
